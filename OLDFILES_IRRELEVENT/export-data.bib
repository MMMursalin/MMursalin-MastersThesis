	abstract = {When we lower the temperature of a liquid, at some point we meet a first order phase transition to the crystal. Yet, under certain conditions it is possible to keep the system in its metastable phase and to avoid crystallization. In this way the liquid enters in the supercooled phase. Supercooled liquids have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from being completely understood. To begin with, there is the problem of how to prevent crystallization and how deeply the liquid can be supercooled before a metastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of supercooled liquids is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is decreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a dramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the system within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a phenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last hundred years. Why does it occur? Is it just a conventional reference point, or does it have a more profound physical meaning? Is it a purely dynamical event, or the manifestation of a true thermodynamic transition? What is the correlation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can we define a new kind of amorphous order? A shared theory of supercooled liquids and the glass transition does not yet exist and these questions are still largely open. Here, I will illustrate in the most elementary fashion the main phenomenological traits of supercooled liquids and discuss in a very partial way a few theoretical ideas on the subject.},

	abstract = {The binary Kob-Andersen ({KA}) Lennard-Jones mixture is the standard model for computational studies of viscous liquids and the glass transition. For very long simulations the viscous {KA} system crystallizes, however, by phase separating into a pure A particle phase forming an {FCC} crystal. We present the thermodynamic phase diagram for {KA}-type mixtures consisting of up to 50{\textbackslash}\% small (B) particles showing, in particular, that the melting temperature of the standard {KA} system at liquid density \$1.2\$ is \$1.028(3)\$ in A particle Lennard-Jones units. At large B particle concentrations the system crystallizes into the {CsCl} crystal structure. The eutectic corresponding to the {FCC} and {CsCl} structures is cut-off in a narrow interval of B particle concentrations around 26{\textbackslash}\% at which the bipyramidal orthorhombic \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {PuBr}\_3\}\$ structure is the thermodynamically stable phase. The melting temperature's variation with B particle concentration at two other pressures, as well as at the constant density \$1.2\$, is estimated from the simulations at pressure \$10.19\$ using isomorph theory. Our data demonstrate approximate identity between the melting temperature and the onset temperature below which viscous dynamics appears. Finally, the nature of the solid-liquid interface is briefly discussed.},

Density functional theory for classical systems, as one of the core theoretical approaches of statistical physics of ﬂuids and solids, has to be able to treat such an important system successfully and accurately. Fundamental measure theory is up to date the most successful and most accurate density functional theory for hard-sphere mixtures. Since its introduction fundamental measure theory has been applied to many problems, tested against computer simulations, and further developed in many respects. The literature on fundamental measure theory is already large and is growing fast. This review aims to provide a starting point for readers new to fundamental measure theory and an overview of important developments.},

	abstract = {Key to resolving the scientific challenge of the glass transition is to understand the origin of the massive increase in viscosity of liquids cooled below their melting temperature (avoiding crystallisation). A number of competing and often mutually exclusive theoretical approaches have been advanced to describe this phenomenon. Some posit a bona fide thermodynamic phase to an ‘ideal glass’, an amorphous state with exceptionally low entropy. Other approaches are built around the concept of the glass transition as a primarily dynamic phenomenon. These fundamentally different interpretations give equally good descriptions of the data available, so it is hard to determine which—if any—is correct. Recently however this situation has begun to change. A consensus has emerged that one powerful means to resolve this longstanding question is to approach the putative thermodynamic transition sufficiently closely, and a number of techniques have emerged to meet this challenge. Here we review the results of some of these new techniques and discuss the implications for the existence—or otherwise—of the thermodynamic transition to an ideal glass.},

	shorttitle = {Geometric Deep Learning},
	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as {CNNs}, {RNNs}, {GNNs}, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulation is the workhorse of various scientific domains but is limited by high computational cost. Learning-based force fields have made major progress in accelerating ab-initio {MD} simulation but are still not fast enough for many real-world applications that require long-time {MD} simulation. In this paper, we adopt a different machine learning approach where we coarse-grain a physical system using graph clustering, and model the system evolution with a very large time-integration step using graph neural networks. A novel score-based {GNN} refinement module resolves the long-standing challenge of long-time simulation instability. Despite only trained with short {MD} trajectory data, our learned simulator can generalize to unseen novel systems and simulate for much longer than the training trajectories. Properties requiring 10-100 ns level long-time dynamics can be accurately recovered at several-orders-of-magnitude higher speed than classical force fields. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two realistic complex systems: (1) single-chain coarse-grained polymers in implicit solvent; (2) multi-component Li-ion polymer electrolyte systems.},

	abstract = {The Brownian motion of two interacting particles through the logrithmic and Lennard–Jones potentials has been treated based on the Smoluchowski equation to check the validity of Einstein's relation between the mean-square displacement and time. The former case is considered analytically to obtain moments as well as the probability density exactly with the orientational motion, and the latter numerically. It is shown that for both cases the mean-square displacement is proportional to time for long times; however, the slope depends on the strength of the potential, showing a deviation from Einstein's relation, and the slope depends mainly on the repulsive interaction. Asymptotic expressions at long time for the logarithmic potential have been obtained in the form of t–P, where t is time. P for the moments for the interparticle distance r;〈ru〉(µ {\textgreater} 0) were found to be –µ/2 independent of the potential parameter, therefore P is the same as the free Brownian motion, whereas those for the probability density and the orientational correlation functions depend strongly upon the potential parameter.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy has led to impressive quantitative models and new insights gained from richer sets of biomedical imagery. However, there is a dearth of rigorous and established bioimaging strategies for modeling spatiotemporal behavior of diffuse, subcellular components such as mitochondria or actin. In many cases, these structures are assessed by hand or with other semi-quantitative measures. We propose to build descriptive and dynamic models of diffuse subcellular morphologies, using the mitochondrial protein patterns of cervical epithelial ({HeLa}) cells. We develop a parametric representation of the patterns as a mixture of probability masses. This mixture is iteratively perturbed over time to fit the evolving spatiotemporal behavior of the subcellular structures. We convert the resulting trajectory into a series of graph Laplacians to formally define a dynamic network. Finally, we demonstrate how graph theoretic analyses of the trajectories yield biologically-meaningful quantifications of the structures.},

	abstract = {A ubiquitous observation in cell biology is that diffusion of macromolecules and organelles is anomalous, and a description simply based on the conventional diffusion equation with diffusion constants measured in dilute solution fails. This is commonly attributed to macromolecular crowding in the interior of cells and in cellular membranes, summarising their densely packed and heterogeneous structures. The most familiar phenomenon is a power-law increase of the {MSD}, but there are other manifestations like strongly reduced and time-dependent diffusion coefficients, persistent correlations, non-gaussian distributions of the displacements, heterogeneous diffusion, and immobile particles. After a general introduction to the statistical description of slow, anomalous transport, we summarise some widely used theoretical models: gaussian models like {FBM} and Langevin equations for visco-elastic media, the {CTRW} model, and the Lorentz model describing obstructed transport in a heterogeneous environment. Emphasis is put on the spatio-temporal properties of the transport in terms of 2-point correlation functions, dynamic scaling behaviour, and how the models are distinguished by their propagators even for identical {MSDs}. Then, we review the theory underlying common experimental techniques in the presence of anomalous transport: single-particle tracking, {FCS}, and {FRAP}. We report on the large body of recent experimental evidence for anomalous transport in crowded biological media: in cyto- and nucleoplasm as well as in cellular membranes, complemented by in vitro experiments where model systems mimic physiological crowding conditions. Finally, computer simulations play an important role in testing the theoretical models and corroborating the experimental findings.

The radial distribution functions ({RDFs}) for five different combinations of atoms of solvent-solvent and solute solvent molecules are studied for structural analysis. At least two or more distinct peaks are observed in {RDFs} plots implying that there are interactions between atoms of solvent solvent and solute solvent at least up to two co ordination shells. The self diffusion coefficients of solute and solvent are determined exploiting mean square displacement ({MSD}) in Einsteins equation. The self diffusion coefficients are used to calculate the binary diffusion coefficients by means of Darkens relation. The calculated values of self diffusion and binary diffusion coefficients are compared with available experimental values and they agreed within 12 percent. The temperature dependency of diffusions are demonstrated via Arrhenius plots and with the help of these plots activation energies for diffusions are calculated which agreed with experimental results within 13 percent.},

              A theory for diffusivity estimation for spatially extended activator–inhibitor dynamics modeling the evolution of intracellular signaling networks is developed in the mathematical framework of stochastic reaction–diffusion systems. In order to account for model uncertainties, we extend the results for parameter estimation for semilinear stochastic partial differential equations, as developed in Pasemann and Stannat (Electron J Stat 14(1):547–579, 2020), to the problem of joint estimation of diffusivity and parametrized reaction terms. Our theoretical findings are applied to the estimation of effective diffusivity of signaling components contributing to intracellular dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in the model organism

To tackle this problem, we performed extensive single-particle tracking experiments on quantum dots in the cytoplasm of living mammalian cells at varying conditions. Analyses of the trajectories reveal a strong, microtubule-dependent subdiffusion with antipersistent increments and a substantial heterogeneity. Furthermore, particles stochastically switch between different mobility states, most likely due to transient associations with the cytoskeleton-shaken endoplasmic reticulum network. Comparison to simulations highlight that all experimental observations can be fully described by an intermittent fractional Brownian motion, alternating between two states of different mobility.},

Especially the cytoplasm has a very complex geometric structure which cannot be handled by standard discretization techniques. In the present paper we propose a homogenization technique for computing effective diffusion constants. This is accomplished by using a two-step strategy. The first step consists of an analytic homogenization from the smallest to an intermediate scale. The homogenization error is estimated by comparing the analytic diffusion constant with a numerical estimate obtained by using real cell geometries. The second step consists of a random homogenization. Since no analytical solution is known to this homogenization problem, a numerical approximation algorithm is proposed. Although rather expensive this algorithm provides a reasonable estimate of the homogenized diffusion constant.},

There exist several different complex modes of diffusion, and discriminating these from each other is challenging at the molecular level owing to underlying stochastic behaviour. Analysis is traditionally performed using

We present here a theoretical approach to study generically a single virus or {DNA} particle trafficking in a cell cytoplasm. Cellular trafficking has been studied experimentally mostly at the macroscopic level, but very little has been done so far at the microscopic level. We present here a physical model to account for certain aspects of cellular organization, starting with the observation that a viral particle trajectory consists of epochs of pure diffusion and epochs of active transport along microtubules. We define a general degradation rate to describe the limitations of the delivery of plasmid or viral particles to the nucleus imposed by various types of direct and indirect hydrolysis activity inside the cytoplasm. Following a homogenization procedure, which consists of replacing the switching dynamics by a single steady state stochastic description, not only can we study the spatio-temporal dynamics of moving objects in the cytosol, but also estimate the probability and the mean time to go from the cell membrane to a nuclear pore. Computational simulations confirm that our model can be used to analyze and interpret viral trajectories and estimate quantitatively the success of nuclear delivery.},

	abstract = {Virus trafficking is fundamental for infection success and plasmid cytosolic trafficking is a key step of gene delivery. Based on the main physical properties of the cellular transport machinery such as microtubules, motor proteins, our goal here is to derive a mathematical model to study cytoplasmic trafficking. Because experimental results reveal that both active and passive movement are necessary for a virus to reach the cell nucleus, by taking into account the complex interactions of the virus with the microtubules, we derive here an estimate of the mean time a virus reaches the nucleus. In particular, we present a mathematical procedure in which the complex viral movement, oscillating between pure diffusion and a deterministic movement along microtubules, can be approximated by a steady state stochastic equation with a constant effective drift. An explicit expression for the drift amplitude is given as a function of the real drift, the density of microtubules and other physical parameters. The present approach can be used to model viral trafficking inside the cytoplasm, which is a fundamental step of viral infection, leading to viral replication and in some cases to cell damage.},

            Biological cells contain large numbers of active proteins that repeatedly change their conformations and need a supply of {ATP} or other substrates to maintain their cyclic operation. Whereas these protein machines have a variety of specific functions, acting as motors, ion pumps, or enzymes, they also induce fluctuating hydrodynamic flows in the cytoplasm. Because such fluctuating flows are nonthermal, energy can be extracted from them and work can be performed. We show that these flows can substantially enhance diffusive motions of passive particles. Furthermore, when gradients in concentrations of active proteins or substrate ({ATP}) are present, a chemotaxis-like drift should take place. Such nonequilibrium effects are universal: They hold for all passive particles and also for the protein machines themselves.

            The cytoplasm and biomembranes in biological cells contain large numbers of proteins that cyclically change their shapes. They are molecular machines that can function as molecular motors or carry out various other tasks in the cell. Many enzymes also undergo conformational changes within their turnover cycles. We analyze the advection effects that nonthermal fluctuating hydrodynamic flows induced by active proteins have on other passive molecules in solution or membranes. We show that the diffusion constants of passive particles are enhanced substantially. Furthermore, when gradients of active proteins are present, a chemotaxis-like drift of passive particles takes place. In lipid bilayers, the effects are strongly nonlocal, so that active inclusions in the entire membrane contribute to local diffusion enhancement and the drift. All active proteins in a biological cell or in a membrane contribute to such effects and all passive particles, and the proteins themselves, will be subject to them.},

            The intracellular environment is a dynamic space filled with various organelles moving in all directions. Included in this diverse group of organelles are vesicles, which are involved in transport of molecular cargo throughout the cell. Vesicles move in either a directed or non-directed fashion, often depending on interactions with cytoskeletal proteins such as microtubules, actin filaments, and molecular motors. How these proteins affect the local fluctuations of vesicles in the cytoplasm is not clear since they have the potential to both facilitate and impede movement. Here we show that vesicle mobility is significantly affected by myosin-{II}, even though it is not a cargo transport motor. We find that myosin-{II} activity increases the effective diffusivity of vesicles and its inhibition facilitates longer states of non-directed motion. Our study suggests that altering myosin-{II} activity in the cytoplasm of cells can modulate the mobility of vesicles, providing a possible mechanism for cells to dynamically tune the cytoplasmic environment in space and time.},
