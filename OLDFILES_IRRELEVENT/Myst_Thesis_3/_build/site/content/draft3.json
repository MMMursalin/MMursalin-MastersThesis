These were verified to be pure elements gasses like oxygen and hydrogen {CITE} and metals like Ytterbium {CITE}.  Properties and interactions of these new elements were tabulated, and trends could be found.

Mathematically he considered the number density of particles evolving with some timestep tau as a Taylor series expansion.\n[EQ 3.1]\nThis required only the consideration that the particle number is conserved, and is based on the continuity equations. He then showed that this evolution of the number density is equivalent to Fick’s laws of diffusion.

Paul Langevin wanted a macroscopic description of the motion of a particle with some random driving force. This was analogous to a macroscopic description of diffusion as the motion of a diffusing particle is caused by random collisions with microscopic particles from its surroundings. To quantify this random force Langevin considered that the noise should obey two properties\n[EQ 4.1, 4.2]\nThat is to say that on average the force is random and thus zero, and has no particle particle nor time correlations due to the delta functions. Considering only a non-interacting particle surrounded by a microscopic fluid he wrote the equation of motion in the form\n[EQ 4.3.0]\nWith this he was able to show the distribution of velocities was fixed\n[EQ 4.3.1]\nHowever with only a random noise term the second moment of the distribution increases with time\n[EQ 4.3.2]\nHowever if a drag term is introduced in the exact form\n[EQ 4.4]\nthen the mean position of the particle is zero and mean squared displacement is related to the strength of the noise, which is the Stokes-Einstein relation. The drag force can also be derived as a random force but is also velocity dependent as more collisions will occur in the direction of travel. The implications of this is quite profound. It says that due to temperature, nature will give you a random force which pushes you, but one cant take advantage of it because the same random process will also hinder you. The Stokes-Einstein relation is only one example of this, and the generalized idea is called a fluctuation dissipation theorem{CITE}. With the Langevin equation of motion, we now have a method to drive particles which we want to diffuse. This innovation was huge in the field of statistical mechanics, as we developed a stochastic differential equation of motion.","position":{"start":{"line":113,"column":1},"end":{"line":113,"column":1}},"key":"S1DvUlQyRV"}],"key":"E0mVZX3xX3"},{"type":"list","ordered":false,"spread":false,"position":{"start":{"line":125,"column":1},"end":{"line":133,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":125,"column":1},"end":{"line":128,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":125,"column":1},"end":{"line":127,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Possible things to add ","position":{"start":{"line":125,"column":1},"end":{"line":125,"column":1}},"key":"yODx3K7Io7"},{"type":"break","position":{"start":{"line":125,"column":1},"end":{"line":125,"column":1}},"key":"ZbLVfHApE8"},{"type":"text","value":"-Fokker Planck ","position":{"start":{"line":125,"column":1},"end":{"line":125,"column":1}},"key":"HFsYApMnl1"},{"type":"break","position":{"start":{"line":125,"column":1},"end":{"line":125,"column":1}},"key":"r0axM5CbX6"},{"type":"text","value":"-Fastest possible reactions as inspiration (Smoluchouski)","position":{"start":{"line":125,"column":1},"end":{"line":125,"column":1}},"key":"fXsnkzFuOi"}],"key":"qHG3jrLA75"}],"key":"VOdO7B7PzV"},{"type":"listItem","spread":true,"position":{"start":{"line":129,"column":1},"end":{"line":133,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":129,"column":1},"end":{"line":132,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Solutions and Mixtures ","position":{"start":{"line":129,"column":1},"end":{"line":129,"column":1}},"key":"WlED4UQLcH"},{"type":"break","position":{"start":{"line":129,"column":1},"end":{"line":129,"column":1}},"key":"lE2m7kn4cW"},{"type":"text","value":"-Some basics (why water solutions)","position":{"start":{"line":129,"column":1},"end":{"line":129,"column":1}},"key":"XWcwf0YniE"},{"type":"break","position":{"start":{"line":129,"column":1},"end":{"line":129,"column":1}},"key":"AkGTaG1kwQ"},{"type":"text","value":"-Mixing","position":{"start":{"line":129,"column":1},"end":{"line":129,"column":1}},"key":"jZvT1a55ku"},{"type":"break","position":{"start":{"line":129,"column":1},"end":{"line":129,"column":1}},"key":"GtMYFGzdhc"},{"type":"text","value":"-Solutions","position":{"start":{"line":129,"column":1},"end":{"line":129,"column":1}},"key":"PKHuG9PdHz"}],"key":"X1Rq0okS3r"}],"key":"cKCNKDnVRs"}],"key":"RbxBlAxrbp"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":134,"column":1},"end":{"line":134,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Caught up in our discussion of the motion of the molecules we neglected the fluid these objects exist in.
