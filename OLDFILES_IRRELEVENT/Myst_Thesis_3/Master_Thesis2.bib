            The intracellular environment is a dynamic space filled with various organelles moving in all directions. Included in this diverse group of organelles are vesicles, which are involved in transport of molecular cargo throughout the cell. Vesicles move in either a directed or non-directed fashion, often depending on interactions with cytoskeletal proteins such as microtubules, actin filaments, and molecular motors. How these proteins affect the local fluctuations of vesicles in the cytoplasm is not clear since they have the potential to both facilitate and impede movement. Here we show that vesicle mobility is significantly affected by myosin-II, even though it is not a cargo transport motor. We find that myosin-II activity increases the effective diffusivity of vesicles and its inhibition facilitates longer states of non-directed motion. Our study suggests that altering myosin-II activity in the cytoplasm of cells can modulate the mobility of vesicles, providing a possible mechanism for cells to dynamically tune the cytoplasmic environment in space and time.},

            Biological cells contain large numbers of active proteins that repeatedly change their conformations and need a supply of ATP or other substrates to maintain their cyclic operation. Whereas these protein machines have a variety of specific functions, acting as motors, ion pumps, or enzymes, they also induce fluctuating hydrodynamic flows in the cytoplasm. Because such fluctuating flows are nonthermal, energy can be extracted from them and work can be performed. We show that these flows can substantially enhance diffusive motions of passive particles. Furthermore, when gradients in concentrations of active proteins or substrate (ATP) are present, a chemotaxis-like drift should take place. Such nonequilibrium effects are universal: They hold for all passive particles and also for the protein machines themselves.
          , 
            The cytoplasm and biomembranes in biological cells contain large numbers of proteins that cyclically change their shapes. They are molecular machines that can function as molecular motors or carry out various other tasks in the cell. Many enzymes also undergo conformational changes within their turnover cycles. We analyze the advection effects that nonthermal fluctuating hydrodynamic flows induced by active proteins have on other passive molecules in solution or membranes. We show that the diffusion constants of passive particles are enhanced substantially. Furthermore, when gradients of active proteins are present, a chemotaxis-like drift of passive particles takes place. In lipid bilayers, the effects are strongly nonlocal, so that active inclusions in the entire membrane contribute to local diffusion enhancement and the drift. All active proteins in a biological cell or in a membrane contribute to such effects and all passive particles, and the proteins themselves, will be subject to them.},

	abstract = {Virus trafficking is fundamental for infection success and plasmid cytosolic trafficking is a key step of gene delivery. Based on the main physical properties of the cellular transport machinery such as microtubules, motor proteins, our goal here is to derive a mathematical model to study cytoplasmic trafficking. Because experimental results reveal that both active and passive movement are necessary for a virus to reach the cell nucleus, by taking into account the complex interactions of the virus with the microtubules, we derive here an estimate of the mean time a virus reaches the nucleus. In particular, we present a mathematical procedure in which the complex viral movement, oscillating between pure diffusion and a deterministic movement along microtubules, can be approximated by a steady state stochastic equation with a constant effective drift. An explicit expression for the drift amplitude is given as a function of the real drift, the density of microtubules and other physical parameters. The present approach can be used to model viral trafficking inside the cytoplasm, which is a fundamental step of viral infection, leading to viral replication and in some cases to cell damage.},

We present here a theoretical approach to study generically a single virus or DNA particle trafficking in a cell cytoplasm. Cellular trafficking has been studied experimentally mostly at the macroscopic level, but very little has been done so far at the microscopic level. We present here a physical model to account for certain aspects of cellular organization, starting with the observation that a viral particle trajectory consists of epochs of pure diffusion and epochs of active transport along microtubules. We define a general degradation rate to describe the limitations of the delivery of plasmid or viral particles to the nucleus imposed by various types of direct and indirect hydrolysis activity inside the cytoplasm. Following a homogenization procedure, which consists of replacing the switching dynamics by a single steady state stochastic description, not only can we study the spatio-temporal dynamics of moving objects in the cytosol, but also estimate the probability and the mean time to go from the cell membrane to a nuclear pore. Computational simulations confirm that our model can be used to analyze and interpret viral trajectories and estimate quantitatively the success of nuclear delivery.},

The tool of choice for monitoring dynamic molecular localization in live cells is fluorescence microscopy, especially so combining total internal reflection fluorescence with the use of fluorescent protein (FP) reporters in offering exceptional imaging contrast for dynamic processes in the cell membrane under relatively physiological conditions compared with competing single-molecule techniques. There exist several different complex modes of diffusion, and discriminating these from each other is challenging at the molecular level owing to underlying stochastic behaviour. Analysis is traditionally performed using
              mean square displacements
              of tracked particles; however, this generally requires more data points than is typical for single FP tracks owing to photophysical instability. Presented here is a novel approach allowing robust

The first step consists of an analytic homogenization from the smallest to an intermediate scale. The homogenization error is estimated by comparing the analytic diffusion constant with a numerical estimate obtained by using real cell geometries. The second step consists of a random homogenization. Since no analytical solution is known to this homogenization problem, a numerical approximation algorithm is proposed.

Despite considerable efforts, the mechanisms behind these observations have remained largely elusive. To tackle this problem, we performed extensive single-particle tracking experiments on quantum dots in the cytoplasm of living mammalian cells at varying conditions. Analyses of the trajectories reveal a strong, microtubule-dependent subdiffusion with antipersistent increments and a substantial heterogeneity. Furthermore, particles stochastically switch between different mobility states, most likely due to transient associations with the cytoskeleton-shaken endoplasmic reticulum network. Comparison to simulations highlight that all experimental observations can be fully described by an intermittent fractional Brownian motion, alternating between two states of different mobility.},

              A theory for diffusivity estimation for spatially extended activator–inhibitor dynamics modeling the evolution of intracellular signaling networks is developed in the mathematical framework of stochastic reaction–diffusion systems. In order to account for model uncertainties, we extend the results for parameter estimation for semilinear stochastic partial differential equations, as developed in Pasemann and Stannat (Electron J Stat 14(1):547–579, 2020), to the problem of joint estimation of diffusivity and parametrized reaction terms. Our theoretical findings are applied to the estimation of effective diffusivity of signaling components contributing to intracellular dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in the model organism

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation is a prominent way of analyzing the dynamic properties of a system. The molecular dynamics simulation of diffusion, an important transport property, of dilute solution of cysteine in SPCE water at five different temperatures (288 K, 293 K, 303 K, 313 K, 323 K) under the pressure of 1 bar is studied using GROMACS. OPLS AA force field parameters are used throughout the simulation. The system under study consists of 3 cysteine molecules (mole fraction 0.003) as solute and 1039 water molecules (mole fraction 0.997) as solvent. The radial distribution functions (RDFs) for five different combinations of atoms of solvent-solvent and solute solvent molecules are studied for structural analysis. At least two or more distinct peaks are observed in RDFs plots implying that there are interactions between atoms of solvent solvent and solute solvent at least up to two co ordination shells. The self diffusion coefficients of solute and solvent are determined exploiting mean square displacement (MSD) in Einsteins equation. The self diffusion coefficients are used to calculate the binary diffusion coefficients by means of Darkens relation. The calculated values of self diffusion and binary diffusion coefficients are compared with available experimental values and they agreed within 12 percent. The temperature dependency of diffusions are demonstrated via Arrhenius plots and with the help of these plots activation energies for diffusions are calculated which agreed with experimental results within 13 percent.},

	abstract = {A ubiquitous observation in cell biology is that diffusion of macromolecules and organelles is anomalous, and a description simply based on the conventional diffusion equation with diffusion constants measured in dilute solution fails. This is commonly attributed to macromolecular crowding in the interior of cells and in cellular membranes, summarising their densely packed and heterogeneous structures. The most familiar phenomenon is a power-law increase of the MSD, but there are other manifestations like strongly reduced and time-dependent diffusion coefficients, persistent correlations, non-gaussian distributions of the displacements, heterogeneous diffusion, and immobile particles. After a general introduction to the statistical description of slow, anomalous transport, we summarise some widely used theoretical models: gaussian models like FBM and Langevin equations for visco-elastic media, the CTRW model, and the Lorentz model describing obstructed transport in a heterogeneous environment. Emphasis is put on the spatio-temporal properties of the transport in terms of 2-point correlation functions, dynamic scaling behaviour, and how the models are distinguished by their propagators even for identical MSDs. Then, we review the theory underlying common experimental techniques in the presence of anomalous transport: single-particle tracking, FCS, and FRAP. We report on the large body of recent experimental evidence for anomalous transport in crowded biological media: in cyto- and nucleoplasm as well as in cellular membranes, complemented by in vitro experiments where model systems mimic physiological crowding conditions. Finally, computer simulations play an important role in testing the theoretical models and corroborating the experimental findings. The review is completed by a synthesis of the theoretical and experimental progress identifying open questions for future investigation.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy has led to impressive quantitative models and new insights gained from richer sets of biomedical imagery. However, there is a dearth of rigorous and established bioimaging strategies for modeling spatiotemporal behavior of diffuse, subcellular components such as mitochondria or actin. In many cases, these structures are assessed by hand or with other semi-quantitative measures. We propose to build descriptive and dynamic models of diffuse subcellular morphologies, using the mitochondrial protein patterns of cervical epithelial (HeLa) cells. We develop a parametric representation of the patterns as a mixture of probability masses. This mixture is iteratively perturbed over time to fit the evolving spatiotemporal behavior of the subcellular structures. We convert the resulting trajectory into a series of graph Laplacians to formally define a dynamic network. Finally, we demonstrate how graph theoretic analyses of the trajectories yield biologically-meaningful quantifications of the structures.},

The former case is considered analytically to obtain moments as well as the probability density exactly with the orientational motion, and the latter numerically. It is shown that for both cases the mean-square displacement is proportional to time for long times; however, the slope depends on the strength of the potential, showing a deviation from Einstein's relation, and the slope depends mainly on the repulsive interaction. Asymptotic expressions at long time for the logarithmic potential have been obtained in the form of t–P, where t is time. P for the moments for the interparticle distance r;〈ru〉(µ {\textgreater} 0) were found to be –µ/2 independent of the potential parameter, therefore P is the same as the free Brownian motion, whereas those for the probability density and the orientational correlation functions depend strongly upon the potential parameter.},

Learning-based force fields have made major progress in accelerating ab-initio MD simulation but are still not fast enough for many real-world applications that require long-time MD simulation. In this paper, we adopt a different machine learning approach where we coarse-grain a physical system using graph clustering, and model the system evolution with a very large time-integration step using graph neural networks. A novel score-based GNN refinement module resolves the long-standing challenge of long-time simulation instability. Despite only trained with short MD trajectory data, our learned simulator can generalize to unseen novel systems and simulate for much longer than the training trajectories. Properties requiring 10-100 ns level long-time dynamics can be accurately recovered at several-orders-of-magnitude higher speed than classical force fields. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two realistic complex systems: (1) single-chain coarse-grained polymers in implicit solvent; (2) multi-component Li-ion polymer electrolyte systems.},

	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

	abstract = {When we lower the temperature of a liquid, at some point we meet a first order phase transition to the crystal. Yet, under certain conditions it is possible to keep the system in its metastable phase and to avoid crystallization. In this way the liquid enters in the supercooled phase. Supercooled liquids have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from being completely understood. To begin with, there is the problem of how to prevent crystallization and how deeply the liquid can be supercooled before a metastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of supercooled liquids is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is decreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a dramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the system within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a phenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last hundred years. Why does it occur? Is it just a conventional reference point, or does it have a more profound physical meaning? Is it a purely dynamical event, or the manifestation of a true thermodynamic transition? What is the correlation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can we define a new kind of amorphous order? A shared theory of supercooled liquids and the glass transition does not yet exist and these questions are still largely open. Here, I will illustrate in the most elementary fashion the main phenomenological traits of supercooled liquids and discuss in a very partial way a few theoretical ideas on the subject.},

For very long simulations the viscous KA system crystallizes, however, by phase separating into a pure A particle phase forming an FCC crystal. We present the thermodynamic phase diagram for KA-type mixtures consisting of up to 50{\textbackslash}\% small (B) particles showing, in particular, that the melting temperature of the standard KA system at liquid density \$1.2\$ is \$1.028(3)\$ in A particle Lennard-Jones units. At large B particle concentrations the system crystallizes into the CsCl crystal structure. The eutectic corresponding to the FCC and CsCl structures is cut-off in a narrow interval of B particle concentrations around 26{\textbackslash}\% at which the bipyramidal orthorhombic \$\{{\textbackslash}rm PuBr\_3\}\$ structure is the thermodynamically stable phase. The melting temperature's variation with B particle concentration at two other pressures, as well as at the constant density \$1.2\$, is estimated from the simulations at pressure \$10.19\$ using isomorph theory. Our data demonstrate approximate identity between the melting temperature and the onset temperature below which viscous dynamics appears. Finally, the nature of the solid-liquid interface is briefly discussed.},

A number of competing and often mutually exclusive theoretical approaches have been advanced to describe this phenomenon. Some posit a bona fide thermodynamic phase to an ‘ideal glass’, an amorphous state with exceptionally low entropy. Other approaches are built around the concept of the glass transition as a primarily dynamic phenomenon. These fundamentally different interpretations give equally good descriptions of the data available, so it is hard to determine which—if any—is correct. Recently however this situation has begun to change. A consensus has emerged that one powerful means to resolve this longstanding question is to approach the putative thermodynamic transition sufficiently closely, and a number of techniques have emerged to meet this challenge. Here we review the results of some of these new techniques and discuss the implications for the existence—or otherwise—of the thermodynamic transition to an ideal glass.},

            Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) within the cell can form biological condensates, which are increasingly recognized to play important roles in various biological processes. Most proteins involved in LLPS are known to be intrinsically disordered proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with low complexity regions (LCRs). The proteins driving LLPS were selected from databases of LLPS-related proteins and then classified into three classes according to the components in the condensates. Through in silico analyses, we found that proteins in the homo class, those that induce LLPS without partner molecules, have different IDRs and LCRs compared with the reference proteome. In contrast, proteins in the other classes, those that induce LLPS with partner proteins (the hetero class) or nucleic acids (the mixed class), did not show a clear difference to the reference proteome in IDRs and LCRs. The hetero-class proteins contained structural domains to serve protein–protein interactions, and the mixed-class ones had the structural domains associated with nucleic acids. These results suggest that IDRs in the homo-class proteins have unique IDRs, which provide multivalent interaction sites required for LLPS, whereas the hetero- and mixed-class proteins can induce LLPS through the combination of the interaction among LCRs, structural domains and nucleic acids.},

              Summary
              Emerging evidences have suggested that liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins plays a vital role both in a wide range of biological processes and in related diseases. Whether a protein undergoes phase separation not only is determined by the chemical and physical properties of biomolecule themselves, but also is regulated by environmental conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, pH, as well as volume excluded by other macromolecules. A web accessible database LLPSDB was developed recently by our group, in which all the proteins involved in LLPS in vitro as well as corresponding experimental conditions were curated comprehensively from published literatures. With the rapid increase of investigations in biomolecular LLPS and growing popularity of LLPSDB, we updated the database, and developed a new version LLPSDB v2.0. In comparison of the previously released version, more than double contents of data are curated, and a new class ‘Ambiguous system’ is added. In addition, the web interface is improved, such as that users can search the database by selecting option ‘phase separation status’ alone or combined with other options. We anticipate that this updated database will serve as a more comprehensive and helpful resource for users.

	abstract = {We present an algorithm to simulate the many-body depletion interaction between anisotropic colloids in an implicit way, integrating out the degrees of freedom of the depletants, which we treat as an ideal gas. Because the depletant particles are statistically independent and the depletion interaction is short-ranged, depletants are randomly inserted in parallel into the excluded volume surrounding a single translated and/or rotated colloid. A configurational bias scheme is used to enhance the acceptance rate. The method is validated and benchmarked both on multi-core processors and graphics processing units for the case of hard spheres, hemispheres, and discoids. With depletants, we report novel cluster phases in which hemispheres first assemble into spheres, which then form ordered hcp/fcc lattices. The method is significantly faster than any method without cluster moves and that tracks depletants explicitly, for systems of colloid packing fraction ϕc \&lt; 0.50, and additionally enables simulation of the fluid-solid transition.},

	abstract = {A statistical mechanical treatment of high polymer solutions has been carried out on the basis of an idealized model, originally proposed by Meyer, which is analogous to the one ordinarily assumed in the derivation of the ``ideal'' solution laws for molecules of equal size. There is obtained for the entropy of mixing of n solvent and N linear polymer molecules (originally disoriented), ΔS=−k[(n/β) ln v1+N ln v2] where v1 and v2 are volume fractions and β is the number of solvent molecules replaceable by a freely orienting segment of the polymer chain. This expression is similar in form to the classical expression for equal-sized molecules, mole fractions having been replaced by volume fractions. When the disparity between the sizes of the two components is great, this expression gives entropies differing widely from the classical values, which accounts for the large deviations of high polymer solutions from ``ideal'' behavior. The entropy of disorientation of a perfectly arranged linear polymer is found to be of the order of R cal. per chain segment. After introducing a suitable heat of mixing term, partial molal free energies are computed, and the calculations are compared with experimental data for all concentrations. Phase equilibria have been calculated in the region of partial miscibility. The theory predicts, in agreement with experiment, that the critical composition for partial miscibility lies at a low concentration of polymer. Low intrinsic viscosities of polymers dissolved in poor solvents are attributed to the tendency for the molecule to assume a more compact configuration in such an environment.},

We describe a robust Monte Carlo simulation method for calculating phase coexistence in multicomponent mixtures. We use this approach to study the phase behavior of lattice models of multicomponent mixtures with strongly varying pair interactions. Such a system can be thought of as a simplified model of the cytosol, with both specific and nonspecific interactions. We show that mapping a multicomponent mixture onto an approximately equivalent one-component system yields both upper and lower bounds on the maximum solute volume fraction of a stable, homogeneous phase. By following the minimum excess-free-energy path from the dilute phase free-energy minimum, we predict the difference in composition between the condensed and dilute phases at the boundary of the homogeneous phase. We find that this “direction” of phase separation rarely aligns with the dominant direction of density fluctuations in the dilute phase. We also show that demixing transitions tend to lower the maximum solute volume fraction at which the homogeneous phase is stable. By considering statistical ensembles of mixtures with random interactions, we show that the demixing contribution to phase separation is self-averaging and dependent only on the mean and variance of the distribution of interactions.},

	abstract = {Phase separation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatial organization inside biological cells. However, despite the clear relevance to virtually all physiological functions, we understand surprisingly little about what phases form in a system of many interacting components, like in cells. Here we introduce a numerical method based on physical relaxation dynamics to study the coexisting phases in such systems. We use our approach to optimize interactions between components, similar to how evolution might have optimized the interactions of proteins. These evolved interactions robustly lead to a defined number of phases, despite substantial uncertainties in the initial composition, while random or designed interactions perform much worse. Moreover, the optimized interactions are robust to perturbations, and they allow fast adaption to new target phase counts. We thus show that genetically encoded interactions of proteins provide versatile control of phase behavior. The phases forming in our system are also a concrete example of a robust emergent property that does not rely on fine-tuning the parameters of individual constituents.},

	abstract = {Turing’s mechanism is often invoked to explain periodic patterns in nature, although direct experimental support is scarce. Turing patterns form in reaction–diffusion systems when the activating species diffuse much slower than the inhibiting species, and the involved reactions are highly nonlinear. Such reactions can originate from cooperativity, whose physical interactions should also affect diffusion. We here take direct interactions into account and show that they strongly affect Turing patterns. We find that weak repulsion between the activator and inhibitor can substantially lower the required differential diffusivity and reaction nonlinearity. By contrast, strong interactions can induce phase separation, but the resulting length scale is still typically governed by the fundamental reaction–diffusion length scale. Taken together, our theory connects traditional Turing patterns with chemically active phase separation, thus describing a wider range of systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that even weak interactions affect patterns substantially, so they should be incorporated when modelling realistic systems.},

	abstract = {The diffusion of enzymes is of fundamental importance for many biochemical processes. Enhanced or directed enzyme diffusion can alter the accessibility of substrates and the organization of enzymes within cells. Several studies based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy report enhanced diffusion of enzymes upon interaction with their substrate or inhibitor. In this context, major importance is given to the enzyme fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, for which enhanced diffusion has been reported even though the catalysed reaction is endothermic. Additionally, enhanced diffusion of tracer particles surrounding the active aldolase enzymes has been reported. These studies suggest that active enzymes can act as chemical motors that self-propel and give rise to enhanced diffusion. However, fluorescence studies of enzymes can, despite several advantages, suffer from artefacts. Here, we show that the absolute diffusion coefficients of active enzyme solutions can be determined with Pulsed Field Gradient Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (PFG-NMR). The advantage of PFG-NMR is that the motion of the molecule of interest is directly observed in its native state without the need for any labelling. Furthermore, PFG-NMR is model-free and thus yields absolute diffusion constants. Our PFG-NMR experiments of solutions containing active fructose-bisphosphate aldolase from rabbit muscle do not show any diffusion enhancement for the active enzymes, nor the surrounding molecules. Additionally, we do not observe any diffusion enhancement of aldolase in the presence of its inhibitor pyrophosphate.},

	abstract = {In 1917, Marian von Smoluchowski presented a simple mathematical description of diffusion-controlled reactions on the scale of individual molecules. His model postulated that a reaction would occur when two reactants were sufficiently close and, more specifically, presented a succinct relationship between the relative proximity of two reactants at the moment of reaction and the macroscopic reaction rate. Over the last century, Smoluchowski reaction theory has been applied widely in the physical, chemical, environmental and, more recently, the biological sciences. Despite the widespread utility of the Smoluchowski theory, it only describes the rates of second order reactions and is inadequate for the description of higher order reactions for which there is no equivalent method for theoretical investigation. In this paper, we derive a generalised Smoluchowski framework in which we define what should be meant by proximity in this context when more than two reactants are involved. We derive the relationship between the macroscopic reaction rate and the critical proximity at which a reaction occurs for higher order reactions. Using this theoretical framework and using numerical experiments we explore various peculiar properties of multimolecular diffusion-controlled reactions which, due to there being no other numerical method of this nature, have not been previous reported.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out for the equation of state and percolation properties of the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) system in its fluid phase as functions of density and temperature. The compressibility factor Z collapses well for the various isotherms, using an effective particle diameter for the WCA particle which is (in the usual WCA reduced units) σe=21∕6∕(1+T)1∕6, where T is the temperature. A corresponding “effective” packing fraction is ζe=πσe3N∕6V, for N particles in volume V, which therefore scales out the effects of temperature. Using ζe the simulation derived Z can be fitted to a simple analytic form which is similar to the Carnahan-Starling hard sphere equation of state and which is valid at all temperatures and densities where the WCA fluid is thermodynamically stable. The data, however, are not scalable onto the hard sphere equation of state for the complete packing fraction range. We explored the continuum percolation behavior of the WCA fluids. The percolation distance σp for the various states collapses well onto a single curve when plotted as σp∕σe against ζe. The ratio σp∕σe exhibits a monotonic decrease with increasing ζe between the percolation line for permeable spheres and the glass transition limit, where σp∕σe≃1. The percolation packing fraction was calculated as a function of effective packing fraction and fitted to an empirical expression. The local coordination number at the percolation threshold showed a transition between the soft core and hard core limits from ca. 2:74 to 1:5, as previously demonstrated in the literature for true hard spheres. A number of simple analytic expressions that represent quite well the percolation characteristics of the WCA system are proposed.},

	abstract = {Summary
          
            Faster growing cells must synthesize proteins more quickly. Increased ribosome abundance only partly accounts for increases in total protein synthesis rates. The productivity of individual ribosomes must increase too, almost doubling by an unknown mechanism. Prior models point to diffusive transport as a limiting factor but surface a paradox: faster growing cells are more crowded, yet crowding slows diffusion. We suspected physical crowding, transport, and stoichiometry, considered together, might reveal a more nuanced explanation. To investigate, we built a first-principles physics-based model of
            E. coli
            cytoplasm in which Brownian motion and diffusion arise directly from physical interactions between individual molecules of finite size, density, and physiological abundance. Using our microscopically-detailed model, we predict that physical transport of individual ternary complexes accounts for {\textasciitilde}80\% of translation elongation latency. We also find that volumetric crowding increases at faster growth even as cytoplasmic mass density remains relatively constant. Despite slowed diffusion, we predict that improved proximity between ternary complexes and ribosomes wins out, illustrating a simple physics-based mechanism for how individual elongating ribosomes become more productive. We speculate how crowding imposes a physical limit on growth rate and undergirds cellular behavior more broadly. Unfitted colloidal-scale modeling offers systems biology a complementary “physics engine” for exploring how cellular-scale behaviors arise from physical transport and reactions among individual molecules.},

We consider potentials composed of a hard-sphere core plus a repulsive term. Specifically, we have investigated square shoulder and repulsive Yukawa terms. We show that, when the range of the interaction is very short, the shoulder potential leads to solid–solid coexistence involving two face-centered cubic structures, in analogy to an attractive square-well potential. Comparison with simulation results shows that the theory is quantitatively correct. If the range of the potentials is sufficiently long, we also find that a body-centered cubic structure can be stabilized. By considering the phase behavior at zero temperature, we argue that several triple points, involving coexistence of fluid and/or solid phases, may occur. A repulsive Yukawa term also shows a region of body-centered cubic stability but, contrary to the square shoulder and attractive Yukawa cases, there is no isostructural solid-solid coexistence. The role of the functional dependence of the interaction potential on particle separation at short distances is discussed and shown to be crucial to generate a solid-solid transition in systems of repulsive particles. Available computer simulation results for this system indicate that the density-functional approximation for the hard-sphere system used in this work, as well as all other currently available approximations, although qualitatively correct, may be overestimating the stability of the body-centered cubic phase.},

            Seemingly simple yet surprisingly difficult to probe, excess protons in water constitute complex quantum objects with strong interactions with the extended and dynamically changing hydrogen‐bonding network of the liquid. Proton hydration plays pivotal roles in energy transport in hydrogen fuel cells and signal transduction in transmembrane proteins. While geometries and stoichiometry have been widely addressed in both experiment and theory, the electronic structure of these specific hydrated proton complexes has remained elusive. Here we show, layer by layer, how utilizing novel flatjet technology for accurate x‐ray spectroscopic measurements and combining infrared spectral analysis and calculations, we find orbital‐specific markers that distinguish two main electronic‐structure effects: Local orbital interactions determine covalent bonding between the proton and neigbouring water molecules, while orbital‐energy shifts measure the strength of the extended electric field of the proton.},

The analysis of the scattering data is adapted from the x-ray methodology to account for multiple scattering in the H2O:Si3N4 sandwich layer. For the H2O layer, we obtain oxygen–oxygen (O–O) and oxygen–hydrogen (O–H) peaks at 2.84 Å and 1.83 Å, respectively, in good agreement with values in the literature.

Devitrification to a nanocrystalline state (Ni7Zr2 structure) was observed at 800 °C, with an increase in density (∼3.6\%) much higher than that achieved in bulk alloys. Variation in the magnetic property of the films and the overall physical structure including morphology and composition were examined before and after annealing. MD simulations were employed to effectively elucidate not only the high densification but also the increased magnetic moment after annealing, which was correlated with the simulated change in the coordination number around Ni atoms. The structural relaxation process accompanying devitrification was described as a disorder-to-order transformation while highlighting the crucial role played by chemical short range order prevalent in glassy materials.},

	abstract = {Developing predictive thermal property models for liquids based on microscopic principles has been elusive. The difficulty is that liquids have gas-like and solid-like attributes that are at odds when considering the frameworks of microscopic models: Models for gases are simple due to randomness and low density, whereas models for crystalline solids rely on symmetry and long-range order for easier calculation. The short-range order in liquids does, however, provide structure to neighboring molecules similar to amorphous solids, and there have been recent advances indicating that collective vibrational modes store heat in liquids. Models combining Debye approximations from solid-state physics and Frenkel’s theory of liquids can accurately predict the heat capacity of liquids. Phonon-like dispersions in liquids have also been widely observed in neutron scattering experiments. These developments motivate us to propose a model where high-frequency vibrational modes, which travel at the speed of sound and have a mean free path on the order of the average intermolecular distance, conduct heat in liquids. We use this liquid phonon gas model to calculate the thermal conductivity of liquids with varying intermolecular interaction energies from strongest to weakest—Coulomb, hydrogen-bonding, Keesom, and London dispersion energy. Generally, the model is more accurate as the intermolecular interaction energy and density of liquids increase. The calculated thermal conductivity of Coulombic-bound molten sodium nitrate and hydrogen-bonded water is within 1.46\% and 2.98\% of the experimentally measured values, respectively, across their entire temperature ranges. Further modal analysis of the velocity and the mean free path of collective vibrations could establish the liquid phonon gas model as an accurate model for weakly interacting liquids as well.},

          , 
            Solvents are crucial components in specialty chemical and pharmaceutical industries and in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes, and are increasingly being used in catalytic reactions. Solvents significantly influence the kinetics and thermodynamics of reactions and can alter product selectivity markedly. While such solvent effects are observed routinely, identification of the root causes of such effects is less frequent. Solvents can influence reaction rates, conversion and product selectivity by 1) directly participating in the reaction steps and opening alternate reaction pathways, 2) competing with the reactant for interaction with the catalysts, 3) changing the relative stabilization of the reactant, the transition state (TS) and/or the product, 4) altering intra-pore diffusion characteristics in porous catalysts, 5) exhibiting entropic confinement effects altering free energy barriers of reactions, 6) changing the solubility of different components in the reaction mixture, and 7) inhibiting undesired reactions. Their indirect influences may be due to 1) changes brought on to active sites on catalysts and 2) altered structure/stability of catalysts. This article discusses these fundamental reasons behind observed solvent effects with suitable examples. Advances in computational chemistry have led to the development of multiple tools and techniques, considering solvents either as implicit or as explicit molecules, providing molecular insights into complex solvent effects in catalysis. This article provides an overview of some of these methods with suitable examples to demonstrate their application and potential. This mapping of the solvent effects and their origins is believed to aid in the rational selection of solvents for catalytic reactions. The description of the computational tools, their application and their potential is likely to encourage widespread use of these techniques to investigate solvent effects.},

            Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a novel principle for explaining the precise spatial and temporal regulation in living cells. LLPS compartmentalizes proteins and nucleic acids into micron-scale, liquid-like, membraneless bodies with specific functions, which were recently termed biomolecular condensates. Biomolecular condensates are executors underlying the intracellular spatiotemporal coordination of various biological activities, including chromatin organization, genomic stability, DNA damage response and repair, transcription, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of these cellular processes is a key event in the initiation and/or evolution of cancer, and emerging evidence has linked the formation and regulation of LLPS to malignant transformations in tumor biology. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the detailed mechanisms of biomolecular condensate formation and biophysical function and review the recent major advances toward elucidating the multiple mechanisms involved in cancer cell pathology driven by aberrant LLPS. In addition, we discuss the therapeutic perspectives of LLPS in cancer research and the most recently developed drug candidates targeting LLPS modulation that can be used to combat tumorigenesis.},
